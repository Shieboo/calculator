# calculator
This is [my Calculator](https://shieboo.github.io/calculator/) for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator?ref=lnav).

- I originally wanted to make it a pure JavaScript Calculator but the floating point error is too much complicated (for me) to solve. So if you want to have better accuracy with decimal number I suggest you turn math.js ON by clicking the button on the bottom left corner of the calculator.

Example of floating point error:

- Using Pure JavaScript:
0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004 (wrong answer)

- Using math.js:
0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3 (correct answer)


## TO-DO:

I'll add keyboard support later but for now I'm happy with the current status of the project.
